India's higher education system is the third largest in the world, next to the United States and China.
The main governing body at the tertiary level is the University Grants Commission, which enforces its standards, advises the government, and helps coordinate between the centre and the state.
Accreditation for higher learning is overseen by 15 autonomous institutions established by the University Grants Commission (UGC).
