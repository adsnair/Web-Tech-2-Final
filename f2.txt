Financing â€“ The inability of the state to fund the expanding higher education system has resulted in the rapid growth of private higher education.
In addition, diminished governmental financial support adversely affects small and rural educational institutions.
A growing number of public institutions are forced to resort to self-financing courses and high tuition costs.
The private sector's primary modes of financing include donations, capitation fees and exorbitant fee rates. 
This in turn limits general accessibility to higher education, by catering to only an elite few.
