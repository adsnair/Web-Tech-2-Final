Enrolment – As of  2007, only around 11% of the 18 – 23 year old population of India, is enrolled in higher education. 
On the whole, India has an enrolment rate of 9% which is similar to that of other lower middle income countries. 
The population that is enrolled in higher education consists largely of urban metropolitan dwellers. 
Rural enrolment in higher education is very low.Moreover, a majority of the recorded enrolment is at the undergraduate level.
Over the last 4 years, Indian higher education has maintained a steady female enrolment rate of around 45%.
Although the gender gap in enrolment has decreased significantly post-independence, there still exists a disparity amongst different departments. 
Technology, medicine and commerce are some of the areas of study that are heavily male-dominated while humanities departments show the opposite trend.
