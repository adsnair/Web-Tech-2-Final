Accreditation - Driven by market opportunities and entrepreneurial zeal, many institutions are taking advantage of the lax regulatory environment to offer 'degrees' not approved by Indian authorities, and many institutions are functioning as pseudo non-profit organisations, developing sophisticated financial methods to siphon off the 'profits'.
Regulatory authorities like UGC and AICTE have been trying to extirpate private universities that run courses with no affiliation or recognition. 
Students from rural and semi-urban background often fall prey to these institutes and colleges.
